### Abstract

This paper reinterprets cognitive dissonance as an epistemic event: the affective signal of finitude and the edge of knowledge. Drawing on Schopenhauer, phenomenology, and social psychology, it argues that dissonance is not anomaly but structure. Ordinarily, it collapses into conformity, obedience, or epistemic clientelism, producing only illusory freedom. Yet when endured, dissonance can yield bounded freedom, fragile in isolation but sustainable through fiduciary scaffolds — institutional duties of candour, accountability, and openness that dignify dependence.

The argument develops across domains. In academia, corporations, journalism, and politics, dissonance is typically pacified through uniformity, yet fiduciary scaffolds can reorient institutions to preserve contradiction. At the frontier — artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and climate governance — the stakes are existential. Here the lure of coherence magnifies fragility, while survival requires epistemic constitutions: frameworks that bind epistemic authorities to sustain plurality under duty.

The conclusion is philosophical. Freedom is bounded, dependence dignified, and survival itself a fiduciary responsibility. Yet dissonance always carries a double horizon: unease may open into freedom, but it may equally collapse into fear. Plurality, though fragile, is the only ground of resilience. At the edge of knowledge, freedom begins — shadowed by fear, yet sustained by the scaffolds that guard unease from silence.

### Working Paper Status

This paper forms part of a wider research programme on fiduciary-epistemic governance and will be integrated into my forthcoming monograph _Beyond Epistemic Clientelism_. Readers are welcome to cite it, but please note that revisions are likely as the material is incorporated into the book project.
